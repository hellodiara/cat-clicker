Cat Clicker app (For Udacity Front-end Nanodegree)

## Project Requirements for Cat Clicker

### Visuals
* The application should display:
	* a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
	* an area to display the selected cat
* In the cat display area, the following should be displayed
	* a picture of the cat
	* text showing the number of clicks
* The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.



### Interaction
* When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
* The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
